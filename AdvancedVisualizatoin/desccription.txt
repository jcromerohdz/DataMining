You have been approached as an analytics consultant by a movie
reviews website. They are writing up an article analysing movie
ratings by critics and audience as well as movie budgets for the
years 2007-2011.

This is the first time they are doing this analysis and they don't
know exactly what they need. They have asked you to look into the
the data and provide them with 5 graphs that tell a story about
the data.

However, there is one chart the CEO specifically requested -
a diagram showing how the corralation between audience and critic
ratings has evolved throughout the years by genre. This is in
addition to the other 5. See the next page for the CEO's "Vision"
