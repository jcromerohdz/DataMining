Test the Law Of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev=1:

Create an R script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide
by the total quantity of N

You know that E(X) = 68.2%
Check that Mean(Xn)->E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N

Hint:
1. Initialize sample size
2. Initialize counter
3. loop for(i in rnorm(size))
4. Check if the iterated variable falls
5. Increase counter if the condition is true
6. return a result <- counter / N
